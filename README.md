# goburnbooks

I was watching a presentation by **Rob Pike** (**Concurrency is not parallelism** <https://vimeo.com/49718712>), and he mentioned the problem of book-burning gophers, whereby there are variable number of book piles/gophers/incinerators and the gophers are responsible for bringing books to the incinerators. Since I'm picking up Golang, might as well build some novice concurrency system just for fun.
